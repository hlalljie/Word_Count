# Word_Count
A command line tool to mimick the built in wcword count tool.

This tool was built as part of a coding challenge that can be found here:

This was my first foray in creating command line tools that run from anywhere in the terminal. The tool can be installed on any mac running python 3.6 or higher.
It also requires installing Click which handles collecting command line arguements and options.
